- I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in [Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) from [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/). During my master's studies, I conducted research under the guidance of Researcher [Shenjun Zhong](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=MV5J9X8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at Monash University. My research interests include medical multi-modality, medical multi-modal LLMs, medical VQA, and remote sensing VQA.
- I enjoy fitness, playing PC games, and collecting a plethora of papers that I might not thoroughly read. If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me. I am happy to collaborate on research projects, and I also welcome companions for fitness (in-person only) and gaming.
